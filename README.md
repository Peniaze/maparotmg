# maparotmg


	This program tells you which realm map you are currently on in order
	to help you track events like ents without having to kill them in quest
	order.

	USAGE:
		Go into a realm, move from beach to the first road and walk it for
		a bit.
		Take screenshot using Alt + Print Screen.
		Press the magic button.
	
	Note: This program works only on the exactly same game setup as mine
		(this will be tweaked in the future)
